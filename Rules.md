# Trapped in a cabin with Lord Byron
(the one page RPG by Oliver Darkshire)

You are on vacation with Lord Byron in his holiday home, but the weather has trapped you and your friends inside the house.
Only the strong will survive.

## Rules
You have three scores : 
- Scandal
- Masterpiece
- Stress

## A new day with Byron
To start your holiday, generate a new Byronic Event by rolling a six-sided die (d6). Adjust your score as directed by the event, then roll a new event.

**Keep rolling new events until your Scandal, Masterpiece or Stress reaches 10**

- If your Scandal reaches 10, you are no longer fit to enter society and must flee to nurse your reputation.
- If your MasterPiece reaches 10, you create a new genre or supernatural horror fiction based on your time with Byron
- If your Stress reaches 10, you loss your patience with the man and either kill him in a fit of rage or otherwise descend into uncontrollable weeping from which you never emerge

## Special rule : Disaster muse
If you roll three 6s in a row, Byron destroys your manuscript either by accident or on purpose, during one of his episodes - reduce that score to 0.
